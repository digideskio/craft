			title: "Software, Faster",
			description: "<b>Formerly Accelerated Agile</b><br><br>Great software professionals build better software faster. Agile methods, continuous delivery and software craftsmanship helped speed up delivery from years to months or even weeks, but then what?<br><br>Some teams are able to deliver software at a speed of change like you have never seen before, delivering quality software in days or even hours, again and again. So what is keeping the rest of us from doing so? Now is the time to go from months to minutes, to rethink the way we organize and improve our software development and delivery process.<br><br>Accelerated Agile is for people who believe it can be done. People who feel themselves limited by current Agile, CD and Craftsmanship thinking. People who want to go back to basics and uncover new, simpler ways to deliver great software. Are you a seasoned agile developer who is frustrated at how slow your “hyper-performing” process feels? Are you suffering with an unwieldy feature backlog, the pantomime of estimation, the card wall where cards go to die, the efforts to automate where it obviously isn’t adding anything? Are you fed up with the artificial commitment of sprints and the unwelcome surprises that still seem to derail your projects?<br><br>Accelerated Agile brings agile principles into the 21st century. You will learn new techniques that both enhance and replace existing agile practices, some of which are counter-intuitive and many which are completely counter to current “agile” doctrine. Using a mixture of discussion, instruction and exploration you will start to think differently about design, architecture, development and testing, operations, automation and team dynamics, as well as working with legacy systems and integrating with third parties.<br><br>What you will learn:<ul><li>How to challenge the received wisdom of established Agile methods<li>How to design and architect for rapid and sustainable delivery<li>Why understanding risk and embracing uncertainty are at the heart of faster delivery<li>How to manage build, release and operations<li>How systems thinking can help you plan effectively and estimate accurately<li>How to identify and reduce gaps in your testing strategy<li>How to engage with legacy systems and integrating with third parties<li>How to manage different levels of skill and experience within a team</ul>",

			description: "Agility is about moving fast and this requires good communication. A consistent, shared vision is essential in order for teams to push in the same direction, but it's surprising that many teams struggle to effectively communicate the architecture of the software they are building. As an industry we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), yet many people favour informal boxes and lines sketches instead. The problem is that such diagrams rarely make any sense, usually need a narrative to accompany them and ultimately slow the team down. Although we can argue whether UML offers an effective way to communicate software architecture, that's often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown out UML or simply don't know it. Abandoning UML is one thing but, in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually too.<br><br>This hands-on session is aimed at those involved in the software development process and is about improving communication. You’ll see some patterns and anti-patterns related to \"boxes and lines\" diagrams, and you’ll learn some lightweight techniques for communicating software architecture using simple sketches.",

As a general rule, splitting application into smaller independent elements helps a lot. <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html\">Microservices</a> is the way to go if possible. Risks aside, in many cases there is no business reason or willingness to adopt continuous delivery. Still, software can be continuously deployed to test servers thus becoming continuous delivery. No matter whether we are doing continuous deployment, delivery, integration or none of those, having automatic and fast deployment with zero downtime and ability to rollback provides great benefits. If for no other reason, because it frees us to do more productive and beneficial tasks. We should design and code our software and let machines do the rest for us.<br><br>In this hands-on workshop we'll build an entire system from scratch following some of best practices for continuous deployment. It will be done in a way that it can be deployed often, be fully automatic and very fast with zero-downtime and ability to rollback.<br><br>We'll use Docker, CoreOS, etcd, systemd, confd, blue-green deployment, microservices, BDD, etc. At the end of the workshop, each participant will gain practical knowledge how to specify, design, develop and test their applications in a way that they can be continuously deployed to production.
